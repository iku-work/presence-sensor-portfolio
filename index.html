    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      This is a webpage describing my work at Retailtech startup company. 
      In Retailtech, we aimed at finding out one of the obvious, but at the 
      same time, before unobtainable metrics - foot trafic at retail spot. 
      The retail store is a challenging place to track a position, because 
      the most accurate method so far, GNSS, obviously, doesn't work indoors.
      Some of the startups were trying to track the shoppers at the store 
      with Ultra Wide Band technology, which will give an accurate positioning, though,
      installations always resulted to be expensive, because a massive amount of
      location beacons must be installed. Some tried to use Bluetooth and WiFi positioning,
      but they also require a lot of beacons and have lower accuracy (2-5m), which is unacceptable.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Retailtech was chosen a different approach: for each spot of interest, installed
      a sensor, which tracks traffic locally. The sensor is a distance sensor, which 
      is constantly measuring the distance, will wait to change in readings and will consider
      that a customer arrived. Based on how close a customer is and how long the stay lasted,
      we decided if person took a product, was interested but didn't buy or were just passing by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though, that this approach given good results in most events, there were some scenarios
      where it had false readings: a shop employee were restocking shelves or person was looking at
      products at the shelf in front of the spot of interest. Therefore, the decision to replace 
      sensor with camera was made.

      <div class="prototype-description">
        <h3>Original sensor</h3>
        <p>This is an original sensor when I first arrived at Retailtech.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A cost effective solution based on HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor and ESP-32 for WiFi connectivity.</li>
          <li>Was equipped with: buzzer, green and red LED, and two buttons.</li>
          <li>Unfortunately, was too bulky, had a cumbersome setup procedure and lower performance with distances over 2m to target.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="prototype-description">
        <h3>Prototype 2 - Infrared Time-Of-Fligth (ToF) sensor</h3>
        <p>An upgraded version of the previous sensor which I was developing.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Enhanced performance and accuracy by around x2-5 times with a smaller size for easier installation.</li>
          <li>Was equipped with: VL53L1X ToF sensor, smaller buzzer, RGB LED and one button.</li>
          <li>Designed enclosure with functionality and manufacturing in mind for an easy assembly.</li>
          <li>Allowed to place the sensor near price tag, which is a great place for taking the readings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Prototype 3 - AI camera based on Raspberry Pi</h3>
        <p>A camera sensor made by our partners, which was connected using WiFi.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 based design</li>
          <li>Used proprietary AI software to detect person presense and movements.</li>
          <li>The design allowed to easily place the sensor in the retail spot.</li>
          <li>Later, I rewrote it to use open-source YOLO model for detecting people, hands and faces</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Updated design, made for installation in the coolers for customers.</li>
          <li>Based on customers request, sensors were equipped with 4G module and sim cards for better connectivity.</li>
          <li>Had camera port, HDMI, USB, CAT-M, GPIO, optional GNSS for outdoor use.</li>
